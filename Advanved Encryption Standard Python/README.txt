To run the code, just run the AES.py file using the command python AES.py or python3 AES.py.

Moreover, if you wish to change the input files, then at the end of the code where the AES object is created, pass the filenames with the following signatures:

AESObject = AES(plainTextFile=<filename>, keyFile=<filename>)

Final result will be stored in the decryption.dec file
